 1. Basically a fall through helps by going through all the statments you want it to and stooping at the one you need it to stop at.
2.  The risk is the statemts will keep coming it wont stop so if you are looking for a spesific case it will not give you that one you are looking for.
3. Producing a visual record of which values are assigned to which parameters
4. I would add more cases




1. I did not use it I used if/ else if and I was still able to add text 
2. I did not have good bracket placement so I had to retyple everything and place the brackets correctly
3. It was kind of second nature for me to reember where I stored information but it just helped in the sense I ddint have to keep looking back to rember something
4. Before I typed something in the computer I thought of how the computer could understand it for example for the last codeing assignment I used a boolean for the ture and fale for the passport.
